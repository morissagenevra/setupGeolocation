How to set up Geolocation spoofing in Kameleo?
Geolocation spoofing settings in Kameleo
You have four options to set the Geolocation spoofing in Kameleo.

You can turn the Geolocation spoofing off. In this case, Kameleo wonâ€™t spoof your geolocation, therefore the website will see your real location.

You can set it on Block, where Kameleo will deny the website access to the Geolocation API. If you deny your Geolocation, you can appear suspicious to websites.

You can set up your Geolocation manually. In this case, you can provide the Latitude and Longitude of the required location, which will be visible on websites. The Location selector tool can help you with this. It is only important that you need to be in the same country as your proxy.
